# hcde-410-final

My HCDE 410 final project examines the factors that most differentiate countries with higher happiness scores from countries with low happiness scores. This analysis leverages data from the World Happiness Report from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) and [OCED Data Explorer](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?lc=en&tm=DF_TABLE1_EXPENDITURE_HCPC&pg=0&snb=1&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_NAMAIN10%40DF_TABLE1_EXPENDITURE_HCPC&df[ag]=OECD.SDD.NAD&df[vs]=&pd=%2C&dq=A.AUS%2BAUT%2BBEL%2BCAN%2BCHL%2BCOL%2BCRI%2BCZE%2BDNK%2BEST%2BFIN%2BFRA%2BDEU%2BGRC%2BHUN%2BISL%2BIRL%2BISR%2BITA%2BJPN%2BKOR%2BLVA%2BLTU%2BLUX%2BMEX%2BNLD%2BNZL%2BNOR%2BPOL%2BPRT%2BSVK%2BSVN%2BESP%2BSWE%2BCHE%2BTUR%2BGBR%2BUSA...B1GQ_POP.......&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=tb), which examines the nominal GDP in different countries over time. The aim of this project from a scientific perspective is to understand what drives the perception of happiness of individuals in their countries and potential trends that emerge in their values and priorities.
