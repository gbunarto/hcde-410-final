This study investigates the relationship between nominal GDP per capita and happiness scores from the World Happiness Report to assess whether GDP is a strong predictor of a country’s happiness. While happiness scores can be subjective, this research aims to understand the impact of economic factors and how they can shape a country’s happiness. Regression analysis is used to examine the correlation between GDP per capita and happiness, with R-squared values helping to evaluate the strength of this relationship. The results show that the correlation between nominal GDP and happiness scores fluctuates, with a low to moderate R-squared value. This suggests that while GDP per capita contributes to happiness, it is not the primary determinant of differences in happiness scores across countries, therefore, disproving my hypothesis that GDP is the main driver of national happiness.
