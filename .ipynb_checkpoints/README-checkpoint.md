# hcde-410-final

My HCDE 410 final project examines the factors that correlate to World Happiness Scores and what differentiates countries with higher scores compared to those with lower happiness scores. This analysis leverages data from the World Happiness Report from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).
